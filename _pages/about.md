I am a third-year PhD student at the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, under the guidance of Professor [Bowen Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=h3Nsz6YAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). I previously earned a Master’s degree in Computer Science and Technology in 2022 from the Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), where I was supervised by [Weinan Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DBLdEf4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Ting Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zyMJ1V0AAAAJ&hl=en) in the HIT-SCIR lab.

My primary research interests focus on the alignment and collaboration of large language models (LLMs), aiming to develop **trustworthy and scalable collaborative intelligence systems**. I am currently focused on developing LLM-based multi-agent reinforcement training framework aimed at advancing reasoning capabilities beyond basic levels (R1 and O1). My research also explores improving collaboration among agents in real-world, agentic tasks.

I am open to potential collaborations and discussions on these topics (like **multi-agent** in [COLM 2024](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08940) / [ACL 2024](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.03129) / [Arxiv 2406](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.12295), **reinforcement learning** in [Arxiv 2412](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01981) / [Arxiv 2502](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01456), **test-time scaling** in [ICLR 2025](https://openreview.net/forum?id=fGIqGfmgkW) / [Arxiv 2502](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06703?) / [Arxiv 2503](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18942) / [Arxiv 2504](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00891), and test-time reinforcement learning in [Arxiv 2504](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16084)) and would be glad to connect with others who share similar interests.
