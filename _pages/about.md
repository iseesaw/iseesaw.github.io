I am a third-year PhD student at the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, under the guidance of Professor [Bowen Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=h3Nsz6YAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). I previously earned a Master’s degree in Computer Science and Technology in 2022 from the Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), where I was supervised by [Weinan Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DBLdEf4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Ting Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zyMJ1V0AAAAJ&hl=en) in the HIT-SCIR lab.

I am open to collaborations and discussions across related areas—such as **multi-agent** ([COLM 2024](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08940), [ACL 2024](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.03129), [Arxiv 2406](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.12295)), **reinforcement learning** ([Arxiv 2412 - ImplicitPRM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01981), [Arxiv 2502 - PRIME](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01456)), **test-time scaling** ([ICLR 2025 - OpenPRM](https://openreview.net/forum?id=fGIqGfmgkW), [Arxiv 2502](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06703?), [Arxiv 2503 - Video-T1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18942), [Arxiv 2504 - GenPRM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00891)), **test-time reinforcement learning** ([Arxiv 2504 - TTRL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16084)), and **multi-agent reinforcement learning** ([GitHub 2025 - MARTI](https://github.com/TsinghuaC3I/MARTI)). I’d be happy to connect with researchers who share these interests.
