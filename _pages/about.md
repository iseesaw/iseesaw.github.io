I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in C3I at the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, under the guidance of Professor [Bowen Zhou](http://c3i.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/author/%E5%91%A8%E4%BC%AF%E6%96%87/). I previously earned a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Technology in 2022 from the Harbin Institute of Technology, where I was supervised by [Weinan Zhang](http://ir.hit.edu.cn/~wnzhang/) and [Ting Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zyMJ1V0AAAAJ&hl=en) in the HIT-SCIR lab.

My primary research interests focus on the alignment and collaboration of large language models (LLMs), aiming to develop trustworthy and scalable collaborative intelligence systems. I am particularly interested in knowledge discovery facilitated by LLMs and the integration of System 1 and System 2 cognitive processes.
